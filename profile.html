        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <p class="paragraphleft">
            So I'm kalm, a 18 years old  vagabond who likes to take pictures and travel based in France. They are my passions. I'm looking for 
            put a smile on people's faces everywhere I travel by creating art.

        <h1 class="titleright">WHERE IT ALL BEGAN</h1>
        <p class="paragraphright">
            To start my little history, I'm going to tell you about my second and last year of high school, that's when I started 
            to be interest in photography. That same year I bought an iPhone and I began to take photos with it, also, I began to
            learn HTML and CSS, I saw in it a continuity to photography and simply a way of making art. During the last year, I
            bought a camera and this is where I really started to learn photographie and art in general.

        <h1>THE FIRST TRAVEL</h1>
        <p class="paragraphleft">
            In february 2022 I went to a litte island in Greece called Santorini. During this journey, I discovered another
            livestyle and landscapes different than my little city. I needed to improve myself to adapt my way of taking pictures,
            it is a real sandbox. I was only a minor and I travelled alone, it allowed me to learn to be autonomous, also more 
            creative and open-minded.

        <h1 class="titleright">PASSAGE TO BIARRITZ</h1>
        <p class="paragraphright">
            In 2022, I started an audiovisual school in option engineering technology and equipment operation (audiovisual) but
            I didn't like it because it didn't have the purpose I wanted. I was to make TV. It was too far from what I wanted : do
            photography and producing (videos, projects...). So I left this school and I was now entering in my vagabond mode. [I took
            too much building pictures.]

        <h1>WINTER 2022-2023</h1>
        <p class="paragraphleft">
            What I call vagabond mode is a lifestyle I took after leaving my school. I needed to change my mind, see my friends.
            That what I did. During this period, I realised that my photos are much better than the firt photos. I realised that the 
            thing I like the most is to take pictures and work on them. I realised that I'm a way more productive and creative. I discovered both much and little about the world.
            I want to continue in this direction to create more art again and again. [This page show you a little part of my progression to take pictures.]
