        <p class="paragraphright">
            To start my little history, I'm going to tell you about my second and last year of high school, that's when I started 
            to be interest in photography. That same year I bought an iPhone and I began to take photos with it, also, I began to
            learn HTML and CSS, I saw in it a continuity to photography and simply a way of making art. During the last year, I
            bought a camera and this is where I really started to learn photographie and art in general.
